          HackExeter is a day-long technology competition for middle-schoolers and high-schoolers. We are initiated, organised, and run by high school students at Phillips Exeter Academy, a private high school in New Hampshire. We are one of the only hackathons aimed at younger students, alongside hackBCA.
        </p>
        <p>
          HackExeter, however, attempts to be a more casual commitment for competitors -- being only eleven hours, it falls better into the "sports game" category than "tech conference". This makes us more attractive to wavering students would otherwise not come to a hackathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        HackExeter has three main guiding philosophies:
        <ul>
          <li> Get unsure students excited about STEM </li>
          <li> Help students realize that technology is primarily a creative exercise </li>
          <li> Help inconfident students realize that they <strong>are</strong> good enough to make cool things </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        HackExeter targets students who "sort of" know how to program, but aren't sure if they want to go through with it. We will have prizes for a number of categories other than "overall best" (like "most creative game concept" or "best abuse of apis"), to encourage unsteady students that they are doing well. Of course, we are also open to confident developers, and we hope that their demos to less-confident students will be inspiring. We try to be a fun day for everyone.

        We want your help!
      </p>
      <p>
        As a sponsor, you will be able to:
        <ul>
          <li> Create an awards category ("the Phllips Exeter Academy prize for best misuse of hardware")</li>
          <li> Distribute company swag at the competition </li>
          <li> Get your company's API recommended to students in our "getting started" document </li>
          <li> Be a part of the contest theme (If you're Phillips Exeter Academy, the theme might be "Big Red")</li>
          <li> Talk briefly about your company at the beginning or end of the contest </li>
          <li> Appear as a sponsor on our website </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can help us by:
        <ul>
          <li> Sponsoring a prize ("the Phillips Exeter Academy championship award") </li>
          <li> Donating money ("this day was made possible by Phillips Exeter Academy") </li>
          <li> Anything else you can think of! </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we are a one-day hackathon, and for the time being only expect students from the New England area, we are a significantly cheaper operation than many "overnight" hackathons.
